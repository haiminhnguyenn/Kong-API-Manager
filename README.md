## üöÄ Description

This is a Flask-based backend application designed to manage Kong Gateway configurations. It provides CRUD operations for services, routes, and plugins on the Kong Gateway. The backend leverages RabbitMQ as a task queue to handle asynchronous requests, ensuring efficient processing of create, update, and delete actions. PostgreSQL is used as the database to store configuration details, allowing for quick retrieval of information when users request it. This architecture ensures optimal performance, scalability, and seamless integration with Kong Gateway, providing a robust solution for managing API gateway configurations.
